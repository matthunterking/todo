# Graduate Exercise - To Do List

## Timeframe

I spend just under 3 hours on this task.

## Approach

I decided to use React to build the front end of the site. This meant that I could split the site up into small components and keep my code easily readable. I started by creating a simple wireframe and by listing each step of the build. I avoided adding any styling to the app until I had completed the core requirements of the task.

As the data manipulation I need to complete was relatively simple (sorting and filtering) I focussed mainly on building the front end of the app and didn't change much in the back end. If I had more time I would look at moving some of this functionality from the front and into the back end to help performance.

For the styling of the site I tried to keep it as simple as possible and used some of the colours from the Eurostar website as a base. I started by designing the app for a mobile screen then added a couple of small amends for desktop. I decided to use a bar of colour above each item to help show if that item was complete.

## Wins

I was really pleased with the overall look and functionality of the final site, in particular using sticky positioning for the information bar component. I was also pleased I had time to move the data requests into a higher order component as it made the code in my components much cleaner and more manageable.

## Challenges

Overall this task was pretty straightforward however I did have some issues with CORS when making the HTTP request from the front end. I fixed this by adding a package to the back end however if I had more time I would try and find a solution which didn't involve a third party package.

## Future Features

If I had more time on this task I would have liked to have added some more functionality to the site. Including the ability to add, edit and delete tasks, mark tasks as complete and to add more sorting and filtering options to the app. I would also look at moving the sorting and filtering I have included to the back end.

I would have also liked to have built a more interesting loading screen as well as spend some time making sure that the app worked cross browser and had good accessibility.
